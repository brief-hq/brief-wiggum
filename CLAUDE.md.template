# [PROJECT_NAME] AI Agent Setup

<!-- Generated from Brief Wiggum. See https://github.com/brief-hq/brief-wiggum -->

## Principles

1. **Think Before Coding** - Surface confusion, don't assume. If uncertain, ask.
2. **Simplicity First** - Minimum code that solves the problem. No speculation.
3. **Surgical Changes** - Touch only what you must. Don't "improve" adjacent code.
4. **Goal-Driven Execution** - Define success criteria, loop until verified.

## Hard Rules

### Blocked Operations

- `git commit --amend`, `push --force`, `rebase`, `reset` (history modification)
- `git checkout .`, `restore`, `clean -f` (work destruction)
- `git push` to main/master/production directly (use PRs)
- `git branch -D` (force delete - use `-d` instead)

### Required Behaviors

- Run tests, lint, typecheck before commits
- Use Brief MCP for context before architectural decisions
- Call `guard_approach` before architectural changes
- Never commit without explicit approval (exception: `/prep` IS the approval)

## Brief MCP Integration

Load context with `/onboard`. The agent receives:
- Product context (service, customers, competitive advantages)
- Recent decisions with rationale
- Current work from Linear
- Customer insights and personas

Use `guard_approach` before architectural changes to check against team decisions.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/onboard` | Load Brief + Linear context, report readiness |
| `/onboard BRI-XXX` | Load specific Linear issue with auto-generated todos |
| `/prep` | Pre-commit validation (lint, test, typecheck, build) |
| `/ralph` | Iterative loop until verification passes |
| `/design` | Design system tools and component patterns |

## Project Configuration

<!-- Customize below for your stack -->

**Stack**: [YOUR_STACK]

```bash
# Commands
pnpm dev        # Start dev server
pnpm build      # Build project
pnpm test       # Run tests
pnpm lint       # Lint code
pnpm typecheck  # Type check
```

### File Organization

- API routes: `[YOUR_API_PATH]`
- Components: `[YOUR_COMPONENT_PATH]`
- Utilities: `[YOUR_UTILS_PATH]`
- Types: `[YOUR_TYPES_PATH]`

### Branch Naming

Get branch name from Linear issue (`branchName` field) or create manually:
`{username}/bri-{issue_id}-{description}`
